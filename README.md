# Roll The Dice

This is a simple web application that allows you to roll a pair of dice and get the total value of the roll. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click the "ROLL THE DICE" button, the dice will shake, and after a short delay, two random dice values will be generated. The corresponding dice images will be displayed, and the total value of the roll will be shown.
